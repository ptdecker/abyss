CLUs for Out of the Abyss

Yup, I realize these are hacked together, should use look-up tables, and all that.  It is really bad code.  But, it works and I only need it for supporting a campaign I'm running with my semi-weekly gaming group.  It is published here in case you find it helpful for your adventuring too.

* 'encounter'   - Determines a random encounter in the Underdark
* 'darklake'    - Determines a random encounter on Darklake within the Underdark
* 'gracklstugh' - Determines a random encounter in Gracklstugh

Enjoy
